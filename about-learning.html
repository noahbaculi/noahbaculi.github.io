						<h3>Programming</h3>
						<p>Although I've been programming since I was 12, I didn't really understand how it could be
							applied to real world projects. Seeing how programming can connect with data across
							disciplines in my first few internships drove me to better understand the advanced
							applications of programming and data analytics. This has led to the pursuit of numerous
							personal coding projects from a music composer to text miner to finance portfolio tracker.

						<h3>Finance</h3>
						<p>So many personal and business decisions are driven or limited by financial resources. I
							started working for a few dollars here or there as an adolescent, doing chores and yard work
							for neighbors. This income in conjunction with my scientific coursework and attitude sparked
							a fascination with personal finance. As I contributed to professional companies, my interest
							expanded to corporate finance as well. I enjoy combining my mathematical mindset with my
							data analytics experience to learn about the applications of financial instruments in
							individual and business situations.</p>

						<h3>Automotive</h3>
						<p>Doing automotive work has been a productive and cost-saving hobby as well as a terrific
							mechanical outlet. From replacing drum brakes to repairing rust spots to adding
							sound-deadening, I love learning new skills and applying them to improve my quality of life.
							Learning about automotive mechanisms and practices has given me a glimpse into the inner
							workings of the machines serve as transportation for so many around the world.</p>

					<h3>Woodworking</h3>
					<p>
						Woodworking has been a hobby of mine since high school.
						Being able to model and construct a physical object
						allows me to apply and extend my experience with
						physical engineering and user-centered design. Most of
						my projects have been functional, such as a backyard
						bench, or vent filter and I thoroughly enjoy being able
						to make something that improves an aspect of someone's
						life.
