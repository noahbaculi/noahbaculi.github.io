						<h3>Singing My Heart Out</h3>
						<p>After some basic piano lessons in elementary school, I joined the school choir in seventh
							grade, paving the way for some tremendous friendships. In high school, I started individual
							voice lessons in order to better contribute to our groupâ€™s musicality. As a result, I was
							invited and contributed to the ACDA All-Northwest chorus in eleventh grade. Our high school
							choir routinely competed in the Oregon State Choir Championships and our choir placed first
							when I was in eleventh grade.</p>

					<h3>Picking Up Guitar</h3>
					<p>In addition to singing, I started teaching myself guitar in tenth grade. I found myself very
						attracted to fingerstyle techniques, striving to play more individual notes rather than just
						chords and embellishments. Especially when I chose to pursue my academic goals instead of
						remaining in the school choir, guitar became a very important therapeutic and recreational
						activity.</p>
