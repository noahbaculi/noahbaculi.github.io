						<h3>Feeling the Waters</h3>
						<p>As an elementary schooler, I had basic swimming lessons that I then built upon in seventh
							grade when I began swimming recreationally with my local YMCA swim team. I learned the
							different strokes and started paying attention to my technique and pacing. I progressed
							quickly and I enjoyed the feeling of such rapid development.</p>

						<h3>Diving In</h3>
						<p>I came to a point in ninth grade when I was outgrowing the recreational focus of the YMCA
							swim team and I chose to move to a club swim team. I started competing more seriously,
							eventually working my way to regularly qualify and compete in the Oregon State Competitions.

					<h3>Friends</h3>
					<p>Throughout my five years of swimming from seventh to eleventh grade, I made so many friendships
						and had an incredible time swimming with my teammates. Working alongside such wonderful people
						to improve ourselves was the most rewarding aspect of swimming for me by far.</p>
