						<h3>Relationships</h3>
						<p>The most frequent reason for my travels is to visit my friends and family all over the
							country. From Oregon where I was raised, to California, Ohio, and Florida. Staying
							connected and sharing experiences with the people that mean the most is my main motivation
							for travel.</p>

						<h3>Opportunity</h3>
						<p>One of my first big trips was to Boston, MA in 2016 to pursue a nanofluidics research
							opportunity. In my college years, my academic and professional ambition has led me to the
							Midwest for both my undergraduate education as well as some fantastic work opportunities!
							I'm so grateful for the people I've encountered along my path and I treasure those
							relationships.</p>

					<h3>Perspective</h3>
					<p>In the summer of 2018, I traveled to Beijing and then Hangzhou in China for a superb study abroad
						experience. We studied energy technology & policy and were sponsored by Northwestern University
						and Wanxiang Group. Not only did I and the other so-named 'Wanxiang Fellows' see the sights and
						feel the culture, but we interacted with energy technology experts and aimed to observe
						first-hand how so many Chinese citizens live everyday through the lens of public health.</p>
