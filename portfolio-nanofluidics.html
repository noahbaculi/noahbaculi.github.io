							The challenge of delving into concepts I never had at such depth before was an amazing
							challenge that I thoroughly enjoyed. After being taught the general premise for the project
							that I would be contributing to, I was assigned the task of comparing the flow of water
							through silica nanochannels with that of water through graphene coated nanochannels. First,
							I earnestly studied the existing theory to better grasp the conceptual foundation on which
							my work would be based. Then, in a clean room, I helped design and manufacture silica and
							graphene-coated silica microchips with nanochannels with which to conduct my observations.

					<p>Next, I used a high-speed microscope camera to film the flow of the water through the silica and
						graphene-coated nanochannels. Then, manipulating the video frames with a MATLAB program and
						produce plots of the water progress allowed me to apply our knowledge of the existing theory to
						characterize the differences in the interactions between water and silica interfaces and the
						water and graphene interfaces. Wrapping up all my observations and conclusions, I presented my
						work at a research symposium.</p>
